Hi, my name is Obumneme Godson Osele. To most folks in the US, I go by Godson. I am a Mechanical Engineering PhD student in the Collaborative Haptics and Robotics in Medicine (CHARM) Lab at Stanford University. My research interests include developing cost-efficient robots exploiting under-actuated, reconfigurable, and soft robotic designs outfitted with innovative sensors to inform autonomous systems and aid human-robot collaboration. I am interested in learning how we can enhance precision and repeatability of tasks with these types of robotic systems while improving the decision-making skills of their users over time. Additional research interests include translating cost-efficient robots into low-resource settings as well as expanding the accessibility of robotics technology and curricula.
