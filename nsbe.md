title: National Society of Black Engineers
description: From the fall of my first year at Northwestern, I have been involved in the National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE). There, I found a community of individuals with similar backgrounds to mine with similar academic and professional goals. This page highlights some of the opportunities I have had to give back to my community as a member of the organization

					<h3>A Walk For Education</h3>
				</header>
				<p>I served on the planning committee for a city-wide event called A Walk For Education aimed to expose young Black students to the opportunities in higher education. Students got exposed to college readiness tools as well as got to interact with different projects from several Illinois institutions, From Northwestern, I recruited the Mechatronics Lab and Concrete Canoe to perform demos for the students. I also sat on a college discussion panel. </p>
