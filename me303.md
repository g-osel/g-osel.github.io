	<p>The project described here is from my Soft Robotics course during my doctoral program. Our team of 3 included myself, Savannah Cofer, Becky Miller.</p>

<p>The teamâ€™s main objective was to  to design, model and fabricate a soft 3D printed under-actuated origami hand consisting of the origami unit cells. The origami unit cell we used was an original design called the Sawhorse developed by Savannah Cofer. We successfully demonstrated underactuated behavior using an origami soft robot with this novel structure of origami block. My primary contribution was the FEA simulation to capture the mechanical behavior of the origami unit cell under loading when fabricated with soft materials.
