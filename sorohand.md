	<p>In an effort to bridge the in-person gap that COVID-19 caused, I took the initiative of reaching out to the director of Northwestern Universityâ€™s Mechatronics lab to work on an individual project with a more direct application of robotics. I expressed my interest in human robot  collaboration in healthcare settings. I recruited a friend to join me on the project. Inspired by robot-assisted surgery systems and soft robotics, we chose to develop a small-scale, low-fidelity telerobotic project. We designed and fabricated a soft silicone mold hand model embedded with nylon wiring. The nylon wires were fixed to servo motors that received commands to adjust the hand via microcontrollers receving human input on a rotary encoder.
