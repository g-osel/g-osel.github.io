title: Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity Incorporated
description: In November of 2018, I became a member of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity Incorporated, a historically Black Greek Lettered Organization, while at Northwestern University. This organization, founded in 1906 at Cornell University, is dedicated to developing leaders, promoting brotherhood and academic excellence, while providing service and advocacy for our communities. This page highlights some of the outreach efforts I have been involved in as part of my time in the fraternity.
