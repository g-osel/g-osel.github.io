Stanford Robotics Center Summer Research Program (SRC SRP) was a 6 week paid research internship for high school students aged 16 or older interested in Robotics/Engineering. The internship targets first generation, low income, and racially minoritized students with the goal of providing real-world experiences in science and engineering research. Students were assigned research projects in labs associated with the Stanford Robotics Center, paired with a lab mentor to help guide them, and given demos on different projects in the lab. They were also given the opportunity to present their work/learnings at a poster session at the end of the program. I handled every aspect of the program: Fundraising ($26,000), Partnerships with schools and nonprofit organizations, Educational content, Mentor recruitment and training, Student wellness, Program administration and communications.


During the program, students:
<ul>
    <li>Performed engineering research at a university</li>
    <li>Gained college readiness skills</li>
    <li>Learned design thinking processes</li>
    <li>Learned technical skills associated with the lab research and how to use special equipment and tools in the lab</li>
    <li>Interacted and learned from world-class researchers</li>
</ul>
