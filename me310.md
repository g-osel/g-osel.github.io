<p>As part of the ME310 Global Design course at Stanford University, my teammates and I, both from Stanford University and Blekinge Institute of Technology in Sweden, were tasked by a corporate sponsor (Volvo CE) with developing a solution for supporting the adoption of Electric Construction Vehicles (ECVs) in areas with broken or non-existent energy infrastructure. Volvo CE has a net-zero emission goal set for 2040. However, the adoption of their electric
equipment over the current standard of diesel machines is limited by the current charging infrastructure of having stationary, grid-connected chargers for ECVs. This especially limits their range of deployment in cases of off-grid construction work and disaster scenarios where the grid is broken. 
<br>
<br>They presented our ME310 Team with the following prompt: 
<i>"How might we support electric vehicle (EV) / alternative energy sources adoption in places where there is no infrastructure (or is broken) but has the greatest needs?"</i><br>
<br>
Over the course of 9 months, our team refined the original prompt and constructed the following problem statement: <i>"How do we accelerate the electrification of construction equipment on remote construction sites?"</i> 

<br><br>
We then utilized rigorous Design Thinking frameworks to systemically investigate a wide variety potential solutions. Our solution was an ECV support system that provides a
remote construction site with temporary energy infrastructure: Oasis, a renewable energy generator, and Nomad, a mobile charging station. We presented a proof of concept with specifications informed by research, benchmarking, low and high fidelity prototyping as well as industry analysis and feedback. The Stanford team, which I was a part of, primarily developed the Nomad system. </p>

<div> Volvo CE decided to highlight our project as part of their "Change Starts Here" campaign which highlights the innovative ways that ECVs can contribute to environmentally sustainable practices in the construction and agricultural industry.  I, along with 3 other teamates, presented the work as part of Volvo CE's exhibit at the 2023 CONEXPO-CON/AGG construction. Here is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2QeHvUqjK0">video</a> of me presenting the work. The project was also featured in a Wu Tsai Neurosciences Institute <a href="https://neuroscience.stanford.edu/news/medical-mixed-reality-applications-take-center-stage-open-house-event?utm_source=Stanford+ALL&utm_campaign=cd2504742a-int_COPY_01&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_c042b4aad7-cd2504742a-54965234">article</a> about medical mixed reality applications.</div> <br>
